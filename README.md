## Instructions

1) Create a responsive HTML page that will switch between the below layouts depending on the screen width. When the screen is larger than `600px` the desktop layout should be used, and when it is smaller the mobile layout should be used
2) You can either use pure CSS or include JavaScript to help with the layout

Feel free to include comments to explain the intention behind what you're doing.
